# CLI Setup — Link Agent to Prava

Link this agent to a Prava account. One-time operation.

## Installation

The CLI is installed by the **user**, not the agent — a global npm install should happen under their control. If it's missing, ask them to run:

```bash
npm install -g @prava-sdk/cli
```

Never run this with `sudo` or elevate privileges on the user's behalf. If it fails on permissions, surface the error and let the user resolve their Node setup.

## Command

```bash
prava setup --name "<name>" --platform <platform> [--description "<desc>"]
```

- `--name` (required) — Descriptive name. "Claude Code", "Cursor", "Alice's Shopping Bot". Not generic like "My Agent".
- `--platform` (required) — The agent platform. See [platforms reference](platforms.md) for the full table. The agent determines this automatically from its own identity — never ask the user.
- `--description` (optional) — Shown on the approval screen.

## Flow

### Step 1 — Generate link

```bash
prava setup --name "Claude Code" --platform claude-code --description "Anthropic's coding agent"
```

The CLI:
- Generates a secure Ed25519 keypair locally
- Registers a pending link with the Prava backend (signing the request with the keypair) and receives a server-issued link id
- Prints a short linking URL pointing to `pay.prava.space`
- **Exits immediately** (does NOT block)

Output:
```
To link this agent, open this URL and approve:
https://pay.prava.space/link-agent?lid=lk_xxx

Link expires in 15 minutes.
Run `prava setup poll` to wait for approval.
```

The URL carries only an opaque link id (`lid`). The agent's name, platform, and description are stored on the backend and fetched by the dashboard when the user opens the link. The link expires 15 minutes after it is created; the backend rejects approval of an expired link.

Because the CLI registers the link with the server up front, `prava setup` requires network access. If the server is unreachable, it prints an error and exits non-zero — re-run once connectivity is restored.

Show the URL to the user:
> To connect to Prava, open this link and approve:
> [URL from output]

### Step 2 — Wait for approval

IMMEDIATELY after showing the URL, run — do NOT wait for the user to respond or confirm:

```bash
prava setup poll
```

The user opens the URL in their browser while the poll waits. Polls for up to 15 minutes. Output on success:
```
Waiting for approval of "Claude Code"...
...

Linked! Agent ID: aa_7kMnP2
Ready to create sessions.
```

If the link expires (15 minutes), the output is:
```
Link expired. Run `prava setup` again.
```

Printed to stderr by both `prava status` (local check, works offline) and `prava setup poll` (when server returns `expired`).

Alternatively, you can skip `setup poll` and just check with `prava status` —
it also detects approval for pending agents.

### Already linked

If agent is already linked, setup is a no-op:
```
Already linked as "Claude Code" (aa_7kMnP2).
```
Exit code: 0 (success, not an error).

## After setup

If the user's original intent was a purchase, proceed IMMEDIATELY
to `prava sessions create`. Do not pause.

Otherwise: "Agent linked! Ready to collect payments."

## Anti-Patterns

- Running setup when already linked (check `prava status` first).
- Asking user for credentials. The CLI handles all auth locally.
- Waiting for user to say "done" — run `prava setup poll` or check `prava status`.

## Troubleshooting: status stuck on "pending" (legacy CLI versions only)

The "stuck pending" failure mode was eliminated in CLI 1.1+ / skill 2.1+: `prava status` now returns either `Link expired` (past the 15-minute TTL) or a `Link: <URL>` line you can re-show the user. These notes cover older CLIs only:

- If the CLI does NOT print `Link expired` but the user can't find the URL, ask the user to upgrade: `npm update -g @prava-sdk/cli`. After upgrading, `prava status` re-prints the URL or returns `Link expired`.
- **Do NOT run `prava setup` again from a troubleshooting path without confirming with the user.** Re-running rotates the keypair and invalidates any link the user might still be about to approve. Exceptions: (1) the CLI explicitly prints `Link expired`, OR (2) the user confirms in this session they want a fresh link.
- If a purchase is pending on an older CLI that doesn't recognize `Link expired`, run `prava sessions create` directly — it has built-in auto-link-check.
- Confirm the user opened the exact URL printed by the most recent `prava setup` (not an older one).
- Check network connectivity — `prava status` falls back to local state when the server is unreachable, which can mask a real approval.
